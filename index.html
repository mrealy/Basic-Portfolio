		<h2> About Me </h2>

		<!--This is a temporary bio-->
		<p> Michael graduated from Columbia College of Chicago with a BA focusing in music composition.  Upon graduation, Michael started began working in Finance and giving private lessons.  Born of entrepeneurs, and frustrated at the resources available for pulling lesson materials together on a weekly basis, Michael is seeking to become a full-stack developer in pursuits of making a website that will be a premium lesson planning service for himself and other music instructors. </p>
